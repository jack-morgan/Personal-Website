## Introduction

The aim of this project is to analyse the publicly available data of Washington DC's bike share system, Capital Bikeshare.
This project aims to provide a clearer picture of the spatiotemporal dynamics of the bikesharing process, and through analysis to understand which aspects might be relevant to the success of the network.
