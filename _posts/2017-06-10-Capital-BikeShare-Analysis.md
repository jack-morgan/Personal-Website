## Intro

The aim of this project is to analyse the publicly available data of Washington DC's bike share system, Capital Bikeshare. By analysing this data, I hope to provide a clearer picture of the spatiotemporal dynamics of the bikesharing process and understand which aspects might be relevant to the success of the network. The dataset includes data such as trip duration, start & end station and the time of day at which the trip was taken.
