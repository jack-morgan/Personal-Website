The [Titanic Kaggle Data Set](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com) is one of the most commonly used when starting out as a data scientist. It provides an easy way to gain 'real-world' experience analysing a dataset, and enables basic machine learning algorithms to be explored. In this project I use both a decision tree classifier and a K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier.
